# BlackBox2 – Assignment 3

This repository contains my solution for **Assignment 3 (BlackBox2)**.  
The goal of this assignment was to analyze, test, and improve an existing Java program using **black-box testing, white-box testing, static analysis, and code review techniques**.

## Project Overview
The project is a Gradle-based Java application. I reviewed the provided code, identified issues through testing and analysis, and applied fixes where necessary. All required documentation and testing artifacts are included in this repository.

## Repository Structure
- `src/` – Java source code
- `build.gradle` / `settings.gradle` – Gradle configuration files
- `gradlew`, `gradlew.bat` – Gradle wrapper scripts
- `blackbox-testing.md` – Black-box testing cases and results
- `whitebox-testing.md` – White-box testing analysis and results
- `static-analysis.md` – Static analysis findings
- `code-review-checklist.md` – Code review checklist and notes

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Barkyx16/BlackBox2.git
